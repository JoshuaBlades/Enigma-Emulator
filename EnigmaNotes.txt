How the rotors work:

3 rotors
--------

	-	For every letter, the first rotor makes one tick
	-	For every 26th tick of the first rotor, the second makes one tick
	-	For every 26th tick of the second rotor, the third one will make one tick

Reflector
---------
	-	Reflector changes the letter after its been through the rotors
	-	Goes back through the 3 rotors
	-	A single letter can never be connected to itself (the fatal flaw)
	-	Automatically set X to Y in setup making sure X != X

Once Rotors set
---------------
	-	Input goes to matched output on R1
	-	R1 gets inputted to R2 relative to regular alphabet 
	-	R2 gets inputted to R3 relative to regular alphabet and you get the output

Decrypt
-------
	-	Reset rotors back to original state
